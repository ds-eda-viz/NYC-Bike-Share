Citibike project.....

In 2020, due to the COVID 19 Pandemic, New York City implemented the lock down and social distance policy. Many Companies requires employees to work from home instead of going to office everyday. We want to analyze the pandemic's influence on New York City residents, specially for 1.6M Manhattan residents who use Citi Bike as part of their commute tools.

In our project, we will break up by different topics:

The Membership analysis (Age, Gender, Annual memberships or Subscriber)

Time Series on Bike Usage (2018 -2020)

Weekday/Weekend Usage

Weather and Temperature affects on the Bike usage

Bike users' routes pattern (How people use it as the commute tool)

The most popular stations and the impact of Covid 19 on the stations
